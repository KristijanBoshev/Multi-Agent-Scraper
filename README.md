# CrewAI Multi-Agent App

## Overview

This CrewAI Multi-Agent App scrapes song transcriptions from Beyoncé's official YouTube channel and matches them to a specific song key provided by the user. For the matched song, the app generates a file that summarizes the song's lyrics. In this specific case, I used the song "Halo" as an example.
